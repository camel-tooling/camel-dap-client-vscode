This is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> extension that adds <a href="https://camel.apache.org/manual/debugger.html">Camel Debugger</a> power by attaching to a running Camel route written in Java, Yaml or XML DSL.
</p><br/>

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/breakpoint.png" alt="A breakpoint hit on a Camel route endpoint and the variables displayed." width="100%"/></p>

### Features

- `Camel Main` mode for XML only (It implies that it is not working with Camel context specified in Camel XML file.)
- Support use of Camel debugger by attaching to a running Camel route written in Java, Yaml or XML using the JMX Url
- Support local use of Camel debugger by attaching to a running Camel route written in Java, Yaml or XML using the PID
- Support remote debug through http (when using Jolokia on server-side)
- Support a single Camel context
- Add/Remove breakpoints
- Support conditional breakpoints with `simple` language. See How to write condition with [simple language](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/languages/simple-language.html) for details.
- Inspect variable values on suspended breakpoints
- Resume a single route instance and resume all route instances
- Pause/resume route definition. Technically, it suspend/stop and resume/start Camel routes depending on the kind of consumer.
- Stepping when the route definition is in the same file
- Allow to update variables:
  - in scope `Debugger`
  - the message body
  - a message header of type String
  - an exchange property of type String
- Commands `Run with JBang and Debug Opened Camel Integration`, `Run with JBang and Debug All Camel Integrations from workspace root` and `Run with JBang and Debug All Camel Integrations from containing folder`. It allows a one-click start and Camel debug in simple cases. This command is available through:
  - Command Palette. It requires a valid Camel file opened in current editor.
  - Contextual menu in File explorer. It is visible to all `*.xml`, `*.java`, `*.yaml` and `*.yml`.
  - Codelens at the top of a Camel file (the heuristic for the codelens is checking that there is a `from` and a `to` or a `log` on `java`, `xml` and `yaml` files).
  - `Run or debug...` quick action editor
- Commands `Run with JBang and Debug Opened Camel Integration`, `Run with JBang Opened Camel Integration` and `Run with JBang All Camel Integrations from workspace root`
  - Support automatic reload mode `--dev` by default
  - It requires a valid Camel file defined in Yaml DSL (`.yaml|.yml`) opened in editor.
  - Contextual menu in File explorer. It is visible to all `*.yaml` and `*.yml`.
  - Codelens at the top of a Camel file.
  - `Run or debug...` quick action editor
- Supports adding extra parameters provided by the `Run with JBang *` commands. (For both running and debugging the application)
- Configuration snippets for Camel debugger launch configuration
- Configuration snippets to launch Camel application ready to accept a Camel debugger connection using JBang, Maven with Camel maven plugin or Quarkus Devs
- Deploy Integration (standalone Camel file) with [Apache Camel Kubernetes](https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang-kubernetes.html) plugin.
  - It allows **one-click deployment into OpenShift** by default
  - requires Camel JBang 4.8+
  - for deployment into Kubernetes cluster see [how to deploy into local Kubernetes cluster](./docs/content/kubernetes-deploy.md)

### Requirements

- **Java Runtime Environment 17+** with `com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine` (available in most JVMs such as Hotspot and OpenJDK). The `java.home` VS Code preferences can be used to use a different version of JDK than the default one installed on the machine.

- The Camel instance to debug must follow these requirements:
  - **Camel 3.16+**
  - Have `camel-debug` on the classpath
  - Have **JMX enabled**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For some features, The [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) must be available on a system command-line.

### How To Debug - example

1. Ensure `jbang` is available on system command-line
2. Open a Camel route which can be started with JBang
3. Call command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), and pick command `Run with JBang and Debug Opened Camel Integration` or click on codelens `Camel Debug with JBang` which appears on top of the file or use the quick editor action
4. Wait until the route is started and debugger is connected
5. Put a breakpoint on the Camel route
6. Debug! üî•
