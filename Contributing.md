  * See latest version on [Microsoft VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel)

  * If already published:
    * Run `npm version --no-git-tag-version patch` so that the version is updated
    * Push changes in a Pull Request
    * Wait for Pull Request to be merged
* Point to a release version of Debug Adapter Server. During development it can point to snapshots but for release it must be a released version.
  * To see current version used, see [scripts/postintall.js](scripts/postinstall.js)
  * See [this doc](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-debug-adapter/blob/main/Contributing.md#how-to-release) to release the server if needed. Please note that it can take several minutes before the new released build is available. Usually less than 30 minutes.
  * If on snapshot, change to released version:
    * Change the version and also change the repository mentioned in [scripts/postintall.js](scripts/postinstall.js) to use `releases` instead of `snapshots` repository

	* Wait for Pull Request to be merged
* Check that someone listed as _submitter_ in the [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) is available
* Check build is working fine on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-dap-client-vscode/actions) and [Jenkins CI](https://studio-jenkins-csb-codeready.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Fuse/job/VSCode/job/vscode-camel-dap-release/)

* Wait the build is waiting on step _Publish to Marketplace_
* Check manually the `vsix` file pushed on [snapshots area](https://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/vscode/snapshots/vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel/)

* Keep build forever for later reference and edit build information to indicate the version
* Create a tag and push it
* Prepare next iteration:
  * Run `npm version --no-git-tag-version patch` to update the version
  * Push changes in a PR
